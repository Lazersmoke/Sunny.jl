When calculating a dynamic structure factor from classical dynamics, it is necessary to generate spin trajetories which are used to calculate correlations. The initial conditions for these trajectories must be sample spin configurations drawn from the equilibrium distribution at the desired temperature. One such trajectory is calculated immediately when initializing a DynamicStructureFactor, so the spins in the sys must represent a good sample before calling this function. Additional sample trajectories are created and accumulated into the DynamicStructureFactor by calling add_sample!(sf, sys). The spins in the sys should be set to new sample configurations before each call to add_sample!. This can be achieved, for example, with the Langevin dynamics.\n\nThree keywords are required to specify the dynamics used for the trajectory calculation.\n\nΔt: The time step used for calculating the trajectory from which dynamic   spin-spin correlations are calculated. The trajectories are calculated with   an ImplicitMidpoint integrator.\nωmax: The maximum energy, ω, that will be resolved.\nnω: The number of energy bins to calculated between 0 and ωmax.\n\nAdditional keyword options are the following:\n\napply_g: Determines whether to apply the g-factor when calculating   trajectories.\nprocess_trajectory: Specifies a function that will be applied to the sample   trajectory before correlation analysis. Current options are :none and   :symmetrize. The latter will symmetrize the trajectory in time, which can   be useful for removing Fourier artifacts that arise when calculating the   correlations.\nobservables: Enables an advanced feature for SU(N) mode, allowing the user to   specify custom observables other than the three components of the dipole. To   use this features, observables must be given an N×N×numops array, where the   final index is used to retrieve each N×N operator.\ncorrelations: Specify which correlation functions are calculated, i.e. which   matrix elements αβ of 𝒮^αβ(qω) are calculated and stored.

This approach makes it possible to apply a temperature- and ω-dependent classical-to-quantum intensity rescaling to the results. This can be done in Sunny by calculating a DynamicStructureFactor and retrieving 𝒮(𝐪) data with instant_intensities, taking care to set the kT keyword to the appropriate value. instant_intensities will then integrate the ω information out after applying intensity corrections.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"library/#Sunny.add_sample!-Tuple{StructureFactor, System}","page":"Library API","title":"Sunny.add_sample!","text":"add_sample!(sf::StructureFactor, sys::System)\n\nadd_trajectory uses the spin configuration contained in the System to generate a correlation data and accumulate it into sf.
