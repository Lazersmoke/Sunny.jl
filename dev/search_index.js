The result is dependent on the magnetic ion species. By default, a first order form factor f is returned. If the keyword g_lande is given a numerical value, then a second order form factor F is returned.\n\nIt is traditional to define the form factors using a sum of Gaussian broadening functions in the scalar variable s = k4π, where k can be interpreted as the magnitude of momentum transfer.\n\nThe Neutron Data Booklet, 2nd ed., Sec. 2.5 Magnetic Form Factors, defines the approximation\n\nlangle j_l(s) rangle = A e^-as^2 + B e^-bs^2 + Ce^-cs^2 + D\n\nwhere coefficients A B C D a b c are obtained from semi-empirical fits, depending on the orbital angular momentum index l = 0 2.

The infos parameter is a list of SpinInfo objects, which determine the magnitude S and g-tensor of each spin.\n\nThe three possible options for mode are :SUN, :dipole, and :large_S. The most variationally accurate choice is :SUN, in which each spin-S degree of freedom is described as an SU(N) coherent state, where N = 2S + 1. Note that an SU(N) coherent state fully describes any local spin state; this description includes expected dipole components Sᵅ, quadrupole components SᵅSᵝ+SᵝSᵅ, etc.\n\nClassical spin models have historically used the expected dipoles alone.  The choice mode=:dipole projects the SU(N) dynamics onto the space of pure dipoles. In practice this means that Sunny will simulate Landau-Lifshitz dynamics, but all single-ion anisotropy or biquadratic exchange interactions will be automatically renormalized to achieve maximum accuracy.\n\nTo disable such renormalization, e.g. to reproduce results collected using the historical large-S classical limit, use mode=:large_S.

When calculating a dynamic structure factor from classical dynamics, it is necessary to generate spin trajetories which are used to calculate correlations. The initial conditions for these trajectories must be sample spin configurations drawn from the equilibrium distribution at the desired temperature. One such trajectory is calculated immediately when initializing a DynamicStructureFactor, so the spins in the sys must represent a good sample before calling this function. Additional sample trajectories are created and accumulated into the DynamicStructureFactor by calling add_sample!(sf, sys). The spins in the sys should be set to new sample configurations before each call to add_sample!. This can be achieved, for example, with the Langevin dynamics.\n\nThree keywords are required to specify the dynamics used for the trajectory calculation.\n\nΔt: The time step used for calculating the trajectory from which dynamic   spin-spin correlations are calculated.

This approach makes it possible to apply a temperature- and ω-dependent classical-to-quantum intensity rescaling to the results. This can be done in Sunny by calculating a DynamicStructureFactor and retrieving 𝒮(𝐪) data with static_intensities, taking care to set the kT keyword to the appropriate value. static_intensities will then integrate the ω information out after applying intensity corrections.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"library/#Sunny.add_sample!-Tuple{StructureFactor, System}","page":"Library API","title":"Sunny.add_sample!","text":"add_sample!(sf::StructureFactor, sys::System)\n\nadd_trajectory uses the spin configuration contained in the System to generate a correlation data and accumulate it into sf.
